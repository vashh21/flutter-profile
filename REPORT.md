## Summary and Reflection

I structured the profile page using a nested row/column approach, making sure the profile picture and name were aligned properly while placing the contact details in a separate row for better organization. Using data models (UserInfo, EducationInfo, ProjectInfo) kept the code clean and scalable. For the projects section, I implemented a dynamic grid that adjusts based on screen width to keep everything responsive.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was handling dimensions and spacing properly across different screen sizes. Initially, the project section boxes were too large on the web, and some elements didnâ€™t scale well. I fixed this by adjusting crossAxisCount dynamically and modifying the childAspectRatio to keep the layout consistent. Bottom overflow errors were another issue, which I resolved by wrapping everything inside SingleChildScrollView. I also made sure that 'Contact Details,' 'Education,' and 'Projects' had the same font size so the sections looked uniform.

This assignment helped me improve my understanding of responsive layouts, adaptive design, and fixing UI constraints in Flutter. I also learned the importance of testing on different screen sizes early on to avoid layout issues later.
