# **Flutter Profile Page**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **Flutter-based profile page application**, originally developed as part of CS 442 MP2. The goal was to create a single-screen **social networking profile page** with structured user information, images, and responsive UI components.  

The app demonstrates **modern UI design principles in Flutter**, emphasizing layout organization, component reusability, and clean code structure. While it started as an academic exercise, I’ve refined and extended it to serve as a personal Flutter learning project.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Dynamic Profile Page:** Displays structured user information in visually distinct sections.  
✅ **Flexible Layout:** Uses **nested Row/Column widgets** for responsive UI.  
✅ **Images & Styling:** Includes **at least three images** with padding, borders, and backgrounds.  
✅ **Data-Driven Design:** Separates layout from content using **data models** (`UserInfo`, `EducationInfo`, `ProjectInfo`).  
✅ **Scrollable UI:** Ensures seamless **vertical scrolling** for mobile and web compatibility.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Flutter** (Dart)  
- **Material Design Components**  
- **ListView, AppBar, Scaffold, Container**

## **Reflections & Learnings**  
While initially developed for an assignment, this project helped me refine **Flutter UI principles** and improve my understanding of **responsive layouts and state management**. I learned:  
- How to **avoid hardcoding data** by using **data models**.  
- Handling **scrolling issues and layout overflows** in Flutter.  
- Structuring **nested widgets efficiently** for **better reusability**.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **Make the UI Interactive:** Add a settings or edit profile button.  
- **Expand Data Model:** Include work experience, hobbies, and more.  
- **Dark Mode Support:** Implement a light/dark mode toggle.
